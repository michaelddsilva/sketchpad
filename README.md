# sketchpad

This sketchpad web app was implemented with FabricJS (http://fabricjs.com/)

FabricJS was used to for the base classes for the canvas, scribble, line, ellipse, and rectangle classes. 

My circle, ellipse, polygon, rectangle, square, and straight line classes inherit from these classes.

The canvas class has its own free-hand functionality, and so, there is no dedicated scribble class. 

The implementation for the classes can be found in sketchpad\src\components\Sketchpad.vue
